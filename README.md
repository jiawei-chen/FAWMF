# FAWMF

This is our raw source code for the paper: <br>
Chen, Jiawei, Can Wang, Sheng Zhou, Qihao Shi, Jingbang Chen, Yan Feng, and Chun Chen. "Fast Adaptively Weighted Matrix Factorization for Recommendation with Implicit Feedback." In AAAI, pp. 3470-3477. 2020.   <br><br><br>
I will share more friendly version (maybe pytorch version) later. 

# Example to run the code.
Here we implement FAWMF in MATLAB. you can run the code for the example data in matlab environment with:
```matlab
 awmf
```
Also, you can run the code awmf.m for other dataset by simply revising the 'trainingdata.txt' and 'testdata.txt' (lines 15,16 in awmf.m) with your paths of training data and test data.
